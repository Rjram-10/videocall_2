# Running the Project with Docker

This section provides instructions to build and run the project using Docker.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.
- Docker version: Compatible with `maven:3.9.4-eclipse-temurin-21` and `eclipse-temurin:21-jre` images.

## Build and Run Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project root directory.
2. Build and start the application using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Configuration

- The application exposes port `8080`.
- Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to adjust configurations if necessary.

## Notes

- Ensure the `target` directory is generated by the Maven build process before running the Docker setup.
- For additional configurations, refer to the `application.properties` file located in `src/main/resources/`.
